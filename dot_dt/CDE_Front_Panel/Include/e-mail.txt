                  ***ATTENTION CDE USERS***
                  =========================

If you are a CDE user and have recently experienced difficulty
opening links and/or HTML documents, please be advised that the
problem is now resolved.

Specifically, CDE users attempting to open links and/or HTML files
out of either DT mail or DT file manager were seeing a pop-up
window related to the deactivation of Netscape 4.79. These items
would not open unless the user followed special instructions. A
newly installed patch automatically fixes the problem by launching
Mozilla 1.4 in place of Netscape 4.79.

However, please note that the patch does not cover the "globe" icon
on the CDE toolbar. It is universally set to launch Netscape 4.79
by default, and there are no plans for upgrading it to Mozilla 1.4.
 
We regret any inconveniences caused. Should your problems persist,
please immediately notify mozilla_interest@central.

Thank you,
