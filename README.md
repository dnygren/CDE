# CDE
Common Desktop Environment (CDE) Helper Files

I really liked the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), using it from 1999 through 2015 - only stopping when Solaris 11 no longer had CDE included. I thought of CDE as a programmer's GUI. I could write small shell scripts to improve my productivity and create my own icons to customize it. Being able actually program a GUI rather than being trapped into a set of menus to customize it was a very liberating experience.

In these files I've gathered together the customizations I made, hoping they may be useful to someone else.
